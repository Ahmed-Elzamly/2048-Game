# 2048 Game Implementation

This project is a Java implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game, created as part of UC Berkeley's CS 61B coursework. The game mechanics are based on sliding tiles to merge numbers and reach the 2048 tile.

## Features
- Fully functional **4x4 grid** with tile sliding and merging logic.
- Random tile spawning (2 or 4) after each move.
- **Game-over detection** when no valid moves are possible.
- Designed using **object-oriented programming principles** for clean and modular code.
- Thoroughly tested with edge cases using **JUnit**.
